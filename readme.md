# OpenTTD in Docker
__An image brought to you by /r/openttd__

Built from OpenTTD JGR source to provide the leanest, meanest image you'll come across for putting trainsets in containers.

See https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches repository.


## Using this Container
```
docker run -d -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp sgobbit/openttd_jgr:latest
```

The container is set by default to start a fresh game every time you restart the container. You can, however, change this behaviour with the `loadgame` envvar:
```
-e "loadgame={false|last-autosave|exit|(savename)}"
```
where:
* false: standard behaviour, just start a new game
* last-autosave: load the last chronological autosave
* exit: try to load autosave/exit.sav, otherwise default to a new game
* (savename): full name of a save file in config/saves

You'll probably want stuff to be persistant between container rebuilds, so we've got the `/config` volume for exactly that purpose.

```
-v /home/{username}/.openttd:/config:rw
```
**Heads up:** If we can't find an `openttd.cfg` in `/config`, we'll attempt to ask OpenTTD to start a new configuration directory there. We strongly recommend that if you're starting fresh, you stop the container and configure openttd.cfg as per [the wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/Openttd.cfg).

If you don't want the entire `.openttd` directory to be copied to your local FS statically, you may want to consider mounting files / directories directly like so:

```
-v /home/{username}/.openttd/openttd.cfg:/config/openttd.cfg:ro
-v /home/{username}/.openttd/save/:/config/save:rw
```
The easiest way to play with NewGRF's is to first download and configure them how you want on a local machine with a GUI. Then in the config/ directory copy the folder from local machine named content_downloaded to the server. Next update the openttd.cfg file from your local machine, this is to ensure that when you create a new server your NewGRF settings will be copied across.

### An example command to start a server
```
docker run -it -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp -v /home/{username}/.openttd:/config:rw -e "loadgame=game.sav" sgobbit/openttd_jgr:latest
```
This will start a server with the console accessible due to ```-it``` in the command line, to run in the background use ```-d```.

## Available Environment Variables

To use these in your `docker run` command, add a flag like so: `-e VARIABLE=data`

| Variable | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `BAN_LIST` | Path to a newline-delimited list of IP addresses to merge into the main configuration file during startup. (If not defined, does not merge, and uses those defined in openttd.cfg)|
| `COPY_CONFIG` | Path to a directory to merge into /config at startup. Basically the only use for this is when you have a read-only configuration that you want to bring in (e.g k8s) but still have a writable active copy in /config. (Important note: Changes WILL NOT be written back to the path defined in `COPY_CONFIG` - this is one-way at container launch.) |

## Defining Bans Externally

For some usage scenarios, you may want to import a list of bans stored in a different location. Some prime uses for this include having a shared ban list between multiple servers, as well as use on Kubernetes (where you want the configuration to be held read-only, but state like the banlist to be stored in a volume).

The [Bans Sidecar](https://github.com/ropenttd/docker_openttd-bans-sidecar) has been built to help with this. See the documentation there for help setting the sidecar up (making sure that you mount `/config` in the same place as this container), then simply set the `BAN_LIST` environment variable to `bans.txt`.

With this set up properly, the sidecar will run occasionally to back up the ban list which OpenTTD writes occasionally to its config file to save things. When the container starts up from scratch, it will automagically merge the bans from both your openttd.cfg and the bans file, write them all to openttd.cfg, and then start up like usual.

## Alpine, OpenTTD, and You

This repo contains a dockerfile for building against Alpine Linux. However, if you try to run a server with openttd compiled on alpine, you’ll get a segmentation fault in saveload as soon as a client tries to connect. From what I’m aware, this is due to a quirk in musl-libc, so at present we’re stuck with using Debian (attempts have been made to shoehorn glibc into alpine with no success). If you succeed at getting OpenTTD to run and serve players with an alpine-derived image, please let us know!
